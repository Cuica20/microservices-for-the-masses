Welcome everyone!

Today, we're going to learn about microservices, their history, how to create them, and communicate between them.

But first, let's learn a little more about each other.

My name is Matt Raible and I'm a hick from the sticks. I grew up in the backwoods of Montana with no electricity or running
water. My sister and I had to walk two miles to school everyday, and yes, it was uphill both ways.

I've lived in Denver since 1992 ... ramble on a bit

[quote, Melvyn Conway, 1967]
Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.

[quote, Martin Fowler, March 2014]
You shouldn't start with a microservices architecture. Instead begin with a monolith, keep it modular, and split it into microservices once the monolith becomes a problem.
