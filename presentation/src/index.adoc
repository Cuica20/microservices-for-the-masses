Welcome everyone!

Today, we're going to learn about microservices, their history, how to create them, and communicate between them.

But first, let's learn a little more about each other.

My name is Matt Raible and I'm a hick from the sticks. I grew up in the backwoods of Montana with no electricity or running
water. My sister and I had to walk two miles to school everyday, and yes, it was uphill both ways.

I've lived in Denver since 1992 ... went to DU, wife, kids, etc. Like to ski, like to mountain bike, love the good beer.

What about you?
Where are you from?

Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.

[quote, Martin Fowler, March 2014]
You shouldn't start with a microservices architecture. Instead begin with a monolith, keep it modular, and split it into microservices once the monolith becomes a problem.

// Spring Boot
== !

image::spring-boot.png[Spring Boot, 200]

[.cue]
****
However, if you have a monolith and want to migrate to microservices, you should definitely check out Spring Boot.
It's a project that's simplified Spring configurations so they barely exist anymore. With smart defaults and auto-configuration,
it allows you to create highly configurable applications that deploy easily.

And don't just take my word for it...

Spring Boot has become the on/off switch of Enterprise Java. Everyone's using it and loves it.

* Create stand-along Spring applications
* Embeds Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow
* Provides opinionated, pre-configured starter poms
* Maven/Gradle and devtools

If you're going to start using Spring Boot, you should first visit start.spring.io. As Josh
Long likes to say, it's one of the happiest places a Java developer can be. You're creating
a new app, maybe playing with new technology. Whee!

Managing microservices requires a lot of organization changes and automation to be successful. Think of products, not projects!

Spring Boot is pretty hip. You know what another hot framework is/was? AngularJS!

== Securing your API

include::{uri-script}[tag=securing-your-api]

[.cue]
****
Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), both frequently referred to as "SSL", are cryptographic protocols that provide communications security over a computer network.

**OAuth2:** The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party
application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on
behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction
between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the
third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.  This
specification replaces and obsoletes the OAuth 1.0 protocol described
in RFC 5849.

****
**JSON Web Tokens**

What is a JSON Web Token, or JWT (pronounced “jot”)?

In a nutshell, a JWT is a secure and trustworthy standard for token authentication. JWTs allow you to digitally sign information (referred to as claims) with a signature and can be verified at a later time with a secret signing key.
****

[.white]
== Anatomy of a JWT

image::jwt.png[Typical JWT,width=600]

image::jwt-decoded.png[Decoded JWT,width=600]

[.cue]
****
In this example, Section 1 is a header which describes the token. Section 2 is the payload, which contains the JWT’s claims, and Section 3 is the signature hash that can be used to verify the integrity of the token (if you have the secret key that was used to sign it).

The claims tell you, at minimum:

Who this person is and the URI to their user resource (the sub claim)
What this person can access with this token (the scope claim)
When the token expires. Your API should be using this when it verifies the token.
****

== Create a JWT in Java

[source,java]
----
String jwt = Jwts.builder()
    .setSubject("users/TzMUocMF4p")
    .setExpiration(new Date(1300819380))
    .claim("name", "Robert Token Man")
    .claim("scope", "self groups/admins")
    .signWith(
      SignatureAlgorithm.HS256,
      "secret".getBytes("UTF-8")
    )
    .compact();
----

== Validating a JWT

[source,java]
----
String jwt = // get JWT from Authorization header
Jws<Claims> claims = Jwts.parser()
    .setSigningKey("secret".getBytes("UTF-8"))
    .parseClaimsJws(jwt)
String scope = claims.getBody().get("scope")
assertEquals(scope, "self groups/admins");
----

[.cue]
****
Short but not Sweet anti-pattern

* Human readable word as secret (should have high degree of random)
* super short, 6 bytes long (HS256 can handle much wider byte array)
* code smell to have human readable and getBytes

****

== Better Secret

[source,java]
----
String b64EncodedSecret =
    "Yn2kjibddFAWtnPJ2AFlL8WXmohJMCvigQggaEypa5E=";

.signWith(SignatureAlgorithm.HS256,
    TextCodec.BASE64.decode(b64EncodedSecret))

If you'd like to see a in-depth presentation on JWTs and how you can
use them to lock down communication between microservices, please
checkout my colleague Micah Silverman's video.

I could go into depth about JWT, but I'd rather code!

== Microservices with JHipster

image::jhipster-microservices-architecture.png[JHipster Microservice Architecture,width=400]

[.cue]
****
In this diagram, green represents JHipster-generated components while blue are the registry and console applications.

You first generate a gateway that handles web traffic and serves up an Angular UI.

The JHipster Registry is a standalone application that you install, rather than generate. All microservices register with this application and get their configuration from it. This application is based on Netflix’s Eureka and Spring Cloud Config.

Microservices are JHipster-generated stateless applications that handle REST requests.

To monitor this architecture you can use JHipster Console, which is based on the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

Now the moment you've all been waiting for - creating microservices with JHipster!

* Convert blog to gateway
* Create store microservice
* Product entity for store, generate UI on gateway
* Deploy to Kubernetes and Docker
